- **Result**: Site now displays with proper Utlyze Blue (#4169E1) branding on light backgrounds

### 2. Section Verification
- **Issue**: Uncertainty about which sections were rendering
- **Fix**: Added data-section attributes to all sections for DOM inspection
- **Result**: Confirmed all sections are present in the code and rendering:

  - ✅ Features Section
  - ✅ Social Proof Section (Testimonials + Stats)
  - ✅ Risk Reversal Section
  - ✅ FAQ Section
  - ✅ Final CTA Section with Email Form
  - ✅ Footer

### 3. Interactive Elements Testing

  - Header "Get Started" button → Opens contact modal ✅
  - Hero CTA button → Opens contact modal ✅
  - Risk Reversal CTA button → Opens contact modal ✅

4. Create sitemap.xml

## Conclusion
