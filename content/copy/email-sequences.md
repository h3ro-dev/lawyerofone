### Email 2: Pain Point Deep Dive
**Subject Lines:**
- The 3 AM contract panic (we've all been there)
- That vendor agreement keeping you up? Let's fix it
- Why smart founders are terrified of contracts

**Sent:** Day 3

**Body:**
{{FirstName}},

It's 3 AM. You're wide awake.

That contract you signed last week keeps replaying in your mind. Page 7, paragraph 3... what did that even mean?

You're not alone. Last month, we surveyed 500 small business owners:

- 84% lose sleep over contracts they've signed
- 67% have caught expensive mistakes... after signing
- 91% wish they had a lawyer on speed dial

Here's the thing: You shouldn't need a law degree to run your business safely.

**Real story:** Marcus, an e-commerce owner, uploaded a standard supplier agreement to Lawyer of One. In 5 minutes, we spotted a clause making him liable for the supplier's legal issues. 

Potential cost: $200,000
Cost to catch it: $0 (free trial)
Marcus's sleep: Restored

**Your turn:**

Still have contracts haunting you? Upload them now and sleep better tonight.

Sweet dreams,

P.S. Most risky clauses hide in sections titled "Miscellaneous" or "General Terms." Now you know where to look first.

### Email 3: Solution Showcase
**Subject Lines:**
- See exactly how we catch contract bombs üí£
- Watch: 10-minute contract review (was 10 days)
- Your lawyer charges $500 for this. We'll show you free

**Sent:** Day 5

**Body:**
Quick question, {{FirstName}}:

What's worse than paying $500/hour for legal help?

Paying $500/hour to watch a lawyer slowly read a contract you could have analyzed yourself.

Let me show you a better way.

**[Watch: 3-minute demo]** How Lawyer of One reviewed a 47-page contract in under 10 minutes:

‚úì Spotted 3 red flags the business owner missed
‚úì Explained each issue in plain English
‚úì Suggested specific fixes to protect the business
‚úì All verified by a licensed attorney

The old way: 5-7 days, $2,500
The Lawyer of One way: 10 minutes, less than lunch

But here's what users love most:

"I finally understand what I'm signing. No more legal Russian roulette." - Rachel K., Designer

### Email 4: Social Proof + Urgency
**Subject Lines:**
- 5,000 businesses just like yours (see their wins)
- From legal nightmare to "I got this" in 30 days
- Sarah saved $500K with one upload. True story.

**Sent:** Day 8

**Body:**
{{FirstName}},

Remember Sarah Chen from our homepage?

She caught a personal liability clause that would have cost her $500K.

I called her yesterday. Here's what she said:

"I almost didn't upload that contract. It looked standard. Thank God I did."

**Sarah's not special.** She's just one of 5,000+ small business owners who stopped playing legal roulette.

This week alone:
- Tom (contractor) caught a non-compete that would've killed his business
- Maria (consultant) found she was agreeing to work for free if clients were "unsatisfied"
- Ahmed (SaaS founder) discovered his vendor could change prices anytime without notice

They all have one thing in common: They took 5 minutes to protect what they spent years building.

**Your free trial ends in 7 days.**

Don't be the founder who wishes they'd acted sooner.

### Email 2: Address Objections
**Subject:** Is this your concern about Lawyer of One?
**Sent:** Day 2

Hi {{FirstName}},

When people don't complete their Lawyer of One signup, it's usually because:

**"I don't have time right now"**
Setup takes 3 minutes. Your first contract review takes 5. Compare that to the weeks you'll spend if something goes wrong.

**"I need to check with my partner/team"**
Smart! Forward them this email. We also have team plans with shared contract libraries.

**"I'm not sure it's worth it"**
The average contract dispute costs $91,000. Our most expensive plan costs less than 1 hour with a lawyer.

**"I want to try it first"**
You can! Start your 30-day free trial with no credit card required.

## Problem-Aware Nurture Series (Weekly for 6 weeks)

### Week 1: Education
**Subject:** The contract clause that killed a $2M business

**Body:**
{{FirstName}},

True story that happened last month:

A marketing agency. $2M revenue. 8 employees. Dead.

The killer? One paragraph in a client contract: "Unlimited revisions until client satisfaction."

The client was never satisfied. 6 months of free work later, the agency folded.

**Lesson:** The most dangerous contract terms sound reasonable.

This week's protection tip: Search every contract for the words "satisfaction," "unlimited," and "sole discretion." These are red flag phrases that give all power to the other party.

Want us to check your contracts for killer clauses?

### Week 2: Case Study
**Subject:** How Rachel caught a career-ending non-compete

**Body:**
{{FirstName}},

Rachel is a freelance designer. Last year, she almost signed a contract that would have ended her career.

Buried on page 12: A 5-year non-compete covering "any creative services" in "any geographic area."

Translation: She couldn't work in her field. Anywhere. For 5 years.

"I was focused on the pay rate," Rachel told me. "I never even made it to page 12."

**Lawyer of One caught it in 30 seconds.**

Rachel negotiated it down to 6 months, same city only. She's still freelancing today.

What's hiding on page 12 of your contracts?

### Week 3: Industry Insights
**Subject:** üö® New legal trap targeting {{Industry}} businesses

**Body:**
{{FirstName}},

Heads up: We're seeing a new problematic clause in {{Industry}} contracts.

**The trap:** "Force majeure excludes pandemics, cyber attacks, and supply chain disruptions."

**Translation:** You're on the hook even when the world falls apart.

3 ways to protect yourself:
1. Never accept blanket force majeure exclusions
2. Negotiate specific carve-outs for your business
3. Always include "and other unforeseen circumstances"

We've updated our AI to flag these automatically.

P.S. Forward this to anyone in {{Industry}}. This clause is spreading fast.

### Week 4: Tool Comparison
**Subject:** Lawyer of One vs. hiring a lawyer (the real numbers)

**Body:**
{{FirstName}},

Let's talk money:

**Traditional Lawyer:**
- Initial consultation: $500
- Contract review: $1,500-$2,500
- Simple question: $200 (minimum)
- Availability: Business hours
- Response time: 3-5 days

**Lawyer of One:**
- Initial consultation: Free
- Contract review: Under $50
- Simple question: Included
- Availability: 24/7
- Response time: 5-10 minutes

But here's what the numbers don't show:

With Lawyer of One, you'll actually USE legal protection. No more avoiding contract reviews because of cost. No more risky handshake deals.

### Week 6: Final Push
**Subject:** The mistake I see every failed business make

**Body:**
{{FirstName}},

After 10 years in legal tech, I've seen hundreds of businesses fail.

The pattern is always the same:

1. They focus on growth over protection
2. They sign contracts without proper review
3. They assume "it won't happen to them"
4. One bad contract destroys everything

I don't want this to be your story.

**Special offer for reading this far:** 

Use code PROTECTED for 40% off your first 3 months. Because businesses that protect themselves are businesses that last.

[Claim Your Protection] ‚Üí

This is my last email in this series. But I'll always be here when you're ready.

Stay safe out there,
Sarah Thompson

P.S. "I wish I had this before I signed that contract" - Every business owner, eventually. Don't wait for your "eventually."
