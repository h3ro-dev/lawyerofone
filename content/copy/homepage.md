## Pain Points Section

### Section Headline
**Sound Familiar?**

### Pain Point 1: The 3 AM Legal Panic
**"Did I miss something in that contract?"**

You signed it last week. Now you're lying awake, wondering if you just agreed to something that could sink your business. That gnawing feeling in your gut? We get it.

### Pain Point 2: The Contract Mountain
**"Another contract. Great."**

Vendor agreements. Client contracts. NDAs. Terms of service. They all land on YOUR desk because you don't have a legal team. You're drowning in legalese while trying to run your business.

### Pain Point 3: The Fine Print Fear
**"What am I not seeing?"**

You know it's there ‚Äì that one clause that could cost you everything. But you're not a lawyer. How are you supposed to spot what you don't know to look for?

### Pain Point 4: The $500/Hour Reality Check
**"I just need a quick answer..."**

But there's no such thing as a "quick" legal question when lawyers bill by the hour. You need guidance, not a second mortgage.
