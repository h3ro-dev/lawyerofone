### Post 1: The Hidden Cost of Legal Fear
It's 3 AM.

You're wide awake, replaying that contract you signed last week.

"What did paragraph 7 actually mean?"
"Did I just agree to something terrible?"
"How much could this cost me?"

I've been there. So have 84% of small business owners we surveyed.

Here's what that fear actually costs you:
→ Lost sleep affecting your decision-making
→ Delayed growth from contract paralysis  
→ Stress impacting your health and relationships
→ Opportunities missed while you hesitate

The tragedy? Most contract fears are unfounded. But without expert eyes, you'll never know.

That's why we built Lawyer of One. Because peace of mind shouldn't require a $50K legal retainer.

What contract is keeping YOU up at night?

### Post 2: The $500/Hour Question
True story from last week:

Small business owner needs a "quick" contract review.
Lawyer quotes 2-3 hours at $500/hour.
Final bill: $1,847

For a 5-page vendor agreement.

This is the reality for 10 million+ small businesses without in-house counsel.

You need legal guidance. But you also need to:
• Make payroll
• Invest in growth
• Keep cash reserves
• Sleep at night

There's a better way. AI-powered contract analysis with attorney oversight.

Same protection. 90% less cost. 

Because your business deserves legal protection that doesn't require a second mortgage.

What's the most shocking legal bill you've received?

### Thread 1: Contract Red Flags 🚩
1/ Every small business owner should know these 5 contract red flags that can destroy your company:

2/ 🚩 "Unlimited revisions until satisfaction"
Translation: Work for free forever.
I've seen this kill entire agencies.

3/ 🚩 "Governing law: [Distant State/Country]"
Translation: Good luck affording that lawsuit.
Always negotiate for your local jurisdiction.

4/ 🚩 "Indemnify and hold harmless for any and all claims"
Translation: You're responsible for THEIR mistakes too.
This is how personal bankruptcy happens.

5/ 🚩 "May modify terms at any time without notice"
Translation: This contract means nothing.
Never agree to unilateral changes.

6/ 🚩 "Automatic renewal unless cancelled 90 days prior"
Translation: You're trapped forever.
Calendar those dates immediately.

7/ Found these in your contracts? You're not alone.

We scan for all 20 major red flags in under 5 minutes.

### Thread 2: The True Cost of DIY Legal
1/ "I'll just use this template I found online"

Famous last words that cost small businesses millions every year.

Here's why DIY legal is Russian roulette 🧵

2/ That "free" template was written for:
- A different state
- A different industry  
- Different circumstances
- Someone else's protection (not yours)

3/ Real example from last month:

Designer used a template service agreement.
Missed: IP ownership clause.
Result: Client owned everything she created.
Cost: Her entire portfolio.

4/ "But lawyers are too expensive!"

You're right. $500/hour is insane for a small business.

That's exactly why AI + attorney oversight is the future.

5/ The smart approach:
✅ Start with quality templates
✅ Customize for your needs
✅ Get expert review
✅ Pay 90% less than traditional legal

6/ Your business is unique.
Your contracts should be too.

Stop gambling with templates.
Start protecting what you've built.

7/ What's your worst template horror story? 👇

### Post 1: Community Question
**Every small business owner has a legal horror story.**

Mine? Almost signed a non-compete that would've prevented me from working in my industry for 5 YEARS. Anywhere in the country. 😱

Caught it just in time thanks to a friend who happened to be a lawyer.

But what if you don't have a lawyer friend?
What if you can't afford $500/hour for "quick questions"?

That's why we built Lawyer of One.

👨‍⚖️ Real attorneys verify everything
⏱️ Results in minutes, not days
💰 Costs less than an hour of traditional legal

### Post 2: Educational Post
**🚨 The #1 Contract Mistake Killing Small Businesses**

We analyzed 10,000 small business contracts last year.

The most expensive mistake? Missing limitation of liability clauses.

**What this means:**
Without this clause, you could be liable for unlimited damages. One client dispute could wipe out everything you've built.

**Real example:**
Marketing agency delivered a campaign. Client claimed it damaged their brand. Without liability limits, agency was sued for $2M (10x the contract value).

**How to protect yourself:**
✅ Always include liability caps (typically 1-2x contract value)
✅ Exclude consequential damages
✅ Get it in writing BEFORE work starts
✅ Have an expert review it

**Remember:** The contract terms you skip today become the lawsuits you face tomorrow.
